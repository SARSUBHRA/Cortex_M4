These files contain Proof-of-Concept (PoC) assembly code for the Cortex-M processor series.
They are designed to validate various groups of instructions within the assembly language.
Each file incorporates additional safety mechanisms in assembly programming to mitigate the risk of software failures in microcontrollers.
The Qualification Test Document includes both the expected and evaluated results of the code, tested using the Keil ÂµVision 5 software simulator. This document supports the validity of the PoC and provides evidence of its effectiveness.
This validation process confirms that the enhanced assembly code contributes to improved safety and reliability in microcontroller operations.
Ultimately, it strengthens the overall safety mechanisms within the microcontroller by ensuring thorough validation of all relevant assembly instruction sets.
